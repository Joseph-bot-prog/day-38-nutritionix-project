Day-38

Today's topics was Exercise tracking with google sheets in python, which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I use?

Worked on various topics that were covered past few days. I used the following APIs to make this project happen:

Nutritionix AI based API that converts natural language into json format.
Sheety used to integrate google sheets with our application.

Project of the day

Exercise Tracker using the above mentioned topics. You can checkout my code. You can also clone and run on local machine using an IDE.

ℹ️ You will need to enter your own API KEY/ Token in keys.py file

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
